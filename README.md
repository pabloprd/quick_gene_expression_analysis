# R35 Moore Nanostring Analysis Functions

This is a simple and specific R package that is created for ease of use for pairwise and 
multiple differential pairwise gene expression. It streamlines a lot of code into functions
so your R code is neater and easier to read. This package specifically only uses limma for pairwise
and multiple differential pairwise gene expression. There are also some plotting functions
that include a boxplot, barplots, and a good volcano plot. 

## Workflow
